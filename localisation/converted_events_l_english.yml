 conv.political.1.a:0 "At least we know who'll control the country..."
 conv.political.1.b:0 "Our Democracy is sacred!"
 conv.political.1.d:0 "The government is weak, they say. Power should be held by just one member, they shout..."
 conv.political.1.t:0 "Absolutism on the Rise"
 conv.political.10.a:0 "We will stop them at any cost!"
 conv.political.10.b:0 "The fascists carry the true spirit of [Root.GetName]!"
 conv.political.10.d:0 "Having been refused their referendum, almost a token attempt at seizing power legally, the fascists have used their significant public support and connections in the [Root.GetAdjective] military to attempt a coup. The [Root.GetRulingParty] government has refused their terms and claims it is going to fight to the end to preserve [Root.GetName] as we know it."
 conv.political.10.t:0 "Fascists March on [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 conv.political.11.a:0 "Pathetic, that's the right word."
 conv.political.11.d:0 "The self-styled King of [Root.GetName] is now dead and his followers forgot how to fight. The people learnt the lesson, our regime is protected by God more than those pathetic old men yelling at clouds."
 conv.political.11.t:0 "Fanatic Reactionaries defeated"
 conv.political.12.a:0 "What a bunch of clowns."
 conv.political.12.d:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] people's infatuation with nationalistic pride and attempts to revive the glories of the past appears to have passed. A rude awakening for its ardent supporters, whose uniforms, militaristic posturing and over-the-top speeches are now more commonly the subject of mockery than sympathies.\n\nOnce considered a threat to the [Root.GetRulingParty] power base, [Root.GetAdjective] fascism is now increasingly seen as an absurd, extremist position and an attack on the most fundamental values of our nation, the very nation they claim to hold in such high regard. The word seems more suited as an insult than a political designation."
 conv.political.12.t:0 "Fascists Ridiculed"
 conv.political.13.a:0 "For the future of [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.13.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Abandons Neutral Foreign Policy"
 conv.political.13_absolutist:0 "The path of monarchy is safer. Absolutism will it be."
 conv.political.13_fascism:0 "After [Root.GetRulingParty]'s recent rise to power, [Root.GetLeader] announced that [Root.GetName] would no longer keep its Neutral Foreign Policy.\n'The world has become tangled and complex. We are no longer safe on our own. We must stand with our fascist partners against our enemies. If we do not choose a side, we will perish alone.'"
 conv.political.2.a:0 "The higher-ups may harbor unspoken sympathies."
 conv.political.2.b:0 "The younger generation will take up the torch."
 conv.political.2.d:0 "'The [Root.GetAdjective] people have been subjected too long to the incompetent rule of [Root.GetRulingParty]! They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe fascist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."
 conv.political.2.t:0 "Fascism on the Rise"
 conv.political.3.a:0 "Our only hope is that they won't organize a coup against us"
 conv.political.3.d:0 "Some may say these are just old man yelling at clouds, but the Reactionary movement is costantly gaining new supporters. What should the government do about this, however, is difficult to tell."
 conv.political.3.t:0 "Reactionary Ideas spreading throughout [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.4.a:0 "*Sigh*, maybe we could give them that figure to avoid the destruction of [Root.GetName]?"
 conv.political.4.d:0 "Our glorious regime is being menaced by our own soldiers. They claim for a strong figure of power, chosen by God Almighty. It will only be a matter of time before they'll embrace arms publicely against [Root.GetName]."
 conv.political.4.t:0 "Absolutist Soldiers won't pledge allegiance to [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.5.a:0 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 conv.political.5.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 conv.political.5.t:0 "The Threat of Communism"
 conv.political.6.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 conv.political.6.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 conv.political.6.t:0 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 conv.political.7.c:0 "At the end, a state must respect the will of its people. [Root.GetName] will hold the referendum"
 conv.political.7.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] is only seen as a usurper by these evergrowing movements in [Root.GetName]. Soon, [Root.GetAdjective] people will revolt against the government, asking for a strong leader chosen by God Almighty. They are now demanding by us to make all humans who believe in the only God to choose whether they want the monarchy or the current regime."
 conv.political.7.t:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] Reactionaries demanding referendum"
 conv.political.8.c:0 "If the people want it, we'll hold the referendum."
 conv.political.8.d:0 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] fascist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 conv.political.8.t:0 "Fascists Demand Referendum"
 conv.political.9.a:0 "Time to show these mediæval protesters how modern war is done."
 conv.political.9.b:0 "In the name of God Almighty, may He choose who to lead [Root.GetName]!"
 conv.political.9.d:0 "Oh, [Root.GetLeader], the people thought you were not chosen by God and they tried to persuade you to do a referendum. But having you denied them, they preferred to do the will of God Almighty by themselves."
 conv.political.9.t:0 "For God to lead [Root.GetName]!"
